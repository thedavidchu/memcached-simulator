# TODO

I want to create a Memcached simulator to gather important statistics for my research.

## Notes

- I can't create issues on a GitHub fork. I will track issues and progress here.

## Changes

From most important to least important.

- [ ] Get stats (e.g. memory usage, miss ratio, metadata usage?)
- [ ] Control time via runner script
- [ ] Reduce memory usage by not storing actual objects (so I can parallelize this?)
